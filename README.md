# Data Science Capstone Project - Predicting Designer Handbag Resale Value  

This project was completed as part of the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly in May 2021.


## Goals

The first goal is to accurately predict the resale value of designer handbags with Linear Regression model and reveal which coefficients has higher impact on predicting the secondary market price.

The second goal is to build classification model to determine whether luxury handbag is a good investment or not, based on derivable variable, Return on Investment (ROI). Next aim is to view the predictive power of each feature and which features generate the best returns.

**Overall Approach**

1. [Acquire data](#Acquire-Data) - data will be scraped and parsed using Requests and Beautiful Soup
2. [Data Cleaning](#Data-Cleaning) - identify missing or inconsistent data.  Store in a clean format ready for processing
3. [EDA](#EDA) - explore the data to identify trends and correlations
4. [Modelling](#Modelling) - train a range of regression models, score, cross-validate and test on unseen data
5. [Evaluation](#Evaluation) - Evaluate and assess limitations of best model in practice against stated aim
6. [Conclusions](#Conclusions)

## Acquire Data

I used the Python libraries Requests and Beautiful Soup to scrape and parse results data published online. Initially I had hoped to collect data using API, but unfortunately, there weren‚Äôt any relevant API or ready collected datasets to implement my capstone project idea. After doing a research where to get the data, it wasn‚Äôt many webpages that has sufficient amount of data information or sites that wasn't blocking you from Web Scraping. I made my choice on Vestiaire Collective webpage. As well as extracting current mean Retail Price from original webpages or public magazines. 

I have decided to go only with 3 top brand in fashion industry and focused my attention to the iconic handbags in each of brand category.

Data acquired:
* 3 Top brands in fashion industry
* 14 features (-> 16 features at preparationg for modelling stage)
* 12,916 unique handbag observations (uncleaned)
* limited edition feature only in Louis Vuitton brand to test one of my hypothesis regarding investment return
* descriptions has been extracted only from Chanel and Hermes handbags
* included categorical feature such as sold out on the resale webpage and bags that are still available online 


The code used for web scraping is included in this notebook - [Handbag Data Collector](Part 2/Web_Scraping_Data_Cleaning.ipynb)


## Data Cleaning

Given the size of the dataset I removed repeated text to reduce filesize, storing athlete and event data in separate reference files, linked by Athlete ID and Event Index respectively.  This left the following columns:

| Column | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| brand | Brand Name |
| title | Secondary market price |
| final_resale_price | Discounted price of secondary market if relevant 
|       | (could be the same as initial price if there is no discount on the handbag) |
| n_likes | Number of likes per handbag |
| limited | Limited edition (yes is 1/ no is 0) |
| model | Specific Name of the Model of handbag |
| condition | Condition of the handbag |
| m_model | Specific Name of the Model of handbag |
| material | Type of the material the handbag made of |
| color | Color of the handbag |
| sold_out | Sold or Not sold (binary) |
| description | Description of the handbag |
| mean_retail_price | Mean Retail Price from original store or official articles |

Data cleaning was, as always, a fairly long and iterative process so I will just highlight a few of the challenges that it presented. 

* Retail price

I had to extract a current retail price manually from brand webpages and public Magazines. Then I calculate the mean value of certain model and hard-coded it in my dataset in 'mean_retail_price' column.

* Discount price

Checking some prices manually, many of them have typos or they weren't true prices. I have dropped very low resale prices for the purpose of modelling.

Overall, I've removed all null values except description column, cleaned each column to have relevant values, extracted and converted string into integers, cleaned duplicates etc. The final dataset consists of 12774 observations. 


## EDA

* This visualisation shows each data point of Hermes brand in my dataset / Comparison of handbag prices

* Here are all Louis Vuitton observations / Comparison of Mean Retail Price with Resale Price and Discounted Resale Price

![LV data points 3D](images/lv.gif)

* Here are each Chanel data / Comparison of 3 prices across each data points

Next I performed thorough EDA to get to know the data, the distributions of the features and the correlations between them.
I have summarised the key findings and plots in the following notebook:
[EDA_Visuals](Part 3/EDA_Data_Visualizations.ipynb)

### The target

Regression models with the continuous numbers of resale value of designer handbags (‚Äòfinal_resale_price‚Äô) as the first target 


To define the second target variable for classification model, final resale price has been transformed into binary class "worth to buy" or "not worth to buy" assigned as 1 or 0 respectively, based on Return on Investment (ROI) above or below 0 in percentage.


### Features

I derived 2 further features from the data to attempt to gain more information on investment returns.

* The ROI column is a derived variable, calculated by subtracting the initial value of the investment from the final value of the investment (which equals the net return), then dividing this new number (the net return) by the cost of the investment, and, finally, multiplying it by 100, to get the percentage value.

* Binary classification target variable based on Return on Investment values (positive - 1, negative - 0)


## Modelling

### Preparing the data

* Feature selection

I selected features that contained information about handbag but no lickage of information of it's Resale Price, then dummidfied the categorical columns.

predictors_reg = ['brand', 'n_likes', 'limited', 'condition', 'm_model', 'material', 
              'color', 'sold_out', 'mean_retail_price']
              
cols_to_dummy = ['brand', 'condition', 'm_model', 'material', 'color']

target_reg = ['final_resale_price']

* Train-Test Split

I applied an 70:30 train-test split to the data.

* Standardisation

I applied the StandardScaler to the features as many of the models I will test require this.


class_predictictors = ['brand', 'n_likes', 'limited','condition', 'm_model', 'material', 'color', 'sold_out']

cols_to_dummy = ['brand', 'condition', 'm_model', 'material', 'color']

target_class = ['good_investment']

I performed the same Train-Test Split with stratifying the target and Standardisation for the classification modelling.


### Fitting and scoring models

I fitted a range of regression models on the training set and obtained R2 scores for training and test set.  I performed 5-fold cross validation and obtained mean CV score to check the generalisability of the model, and also calculated RMSE of the predictions.

Finding the best model - Scores

![Regression Models scoring](images/Models_Findings_Technical_Report.jpg)

The simple Linear Regression model performs quite well with consistent train, test and mean CV scores.  Adding regularisation with the Ridge and Elastic Net models did not alter the results. The Gradient Boosting Regressor model showed significant improvement in R2 scores and errors.

The Classification models have much stronger scores at predicting a designer handbag to be whether good investment or opposite. Baseline predictions for classification models is 0.678, whereas most models have Mean CV  ùëÖ2  train and  ùëÖ2  test scores of 0.83-0.84. The best performance has Grid Search Gradient Boosting Classifier with an Mean CV  ùëÖ2  score of 0.8449 on train data and an  ùëÖ2  score of 0.8518 on unseen data, which is really great.

## Evaluation

Examples of the best models and evaluation can be found in the following notebook:
[Modelling_findings](Predictive_Models_Findings_Technical_Report.ipynb)


### Limitations

* Time info

One of the biggest limitations was absence of the time when the handbag was made, it would be really cool to use time values to see the changes of pricing across all models over time. 

I would like to answer the questions, like:
* What is a good investment over time?
* How much time you need for it to raise or drop in value?
* How long should I hold bag before sale?
* How do iconic value change over time? (predicting the value in the future)

Hermes and Chanel have such a¬†strong influence¬†in the fashion world that they have the ability to rapidly increase prices in a short period of time 


## Conclusions

Key points to make your purchase a good investment:

* Limited Editions
Limited edition bags are an interesting prospect as they provide an excellent opportunity for investment, but only if the right styles are chosen. 

* Patience is a Virtue
One of the most important things to remember when purchasing an investment piece is patience. The wait after you have made the purchase. Don‚Äôt buy a bag and expect a return immediately. It may take a few years for your investment to grow, so be prepared to that. However, this doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt use your bag as long as you‚Ä¶

* Maintain the Condition
When reselling an investment piece, the most import factor in determining the resell price is the condition. If you keep your bag in pristine, excellent, or even very good condition you can expect an excellent return. However, if your bag is full of scratches or watermarks, you won‚Äôt get the most from your investment.

To get the most resale value for your investment bag, invest in the holy trinity:
* Herm√®s Birkin and Kelly handbags with exotic leathers
* Louis Vuitton handbags limited editions
* Chanel Woc / Classic flaps

While the value of luxury handbags can fluctuate due to trends or buzz, these three iconic brands in certain styles have the most resale value.
The Birkin is expected to only increase in value going forward. Its high retail price, limited availability, and strong presence on the secondary market demonstrate that it is still a highly coveted piece. 
Kelly holds its value well in the secondary market just like the Birkin. Both bags are exclusive and difficult to procure. Due to its limited availability and high appeal. Anything that is hard to get is highly coveted.


Recommended Price for your handbag for Resale

Overall this has been an interesting and worthwhile project. A full range of regression and classification modelling techniques were employed and the models scored highly on the selected featured of the dataset. The next steps for this project would be:
- Add more detailed features of the date the handbag was made
- Collect data on retail price of the handbag of certain year, retrain and evaluate the model.
- Use other techniques such as clustering and network analysis to identify handbag characteristics and features.
